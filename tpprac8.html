    <p id="p1">By changing the high beam illumination distribution according to the situation, it is possible to use low beams to illuminate oncoming vehicles and vehicles in front of you and to use high beams to illuminate other areas.
        This makes it easier to see pedestrians and signs on the sides of the road, and also improves visibility on curves.</p>
    <h1><ul type="square"><li>System operation</li></ul></h1>
    <hr id="line">
    <p id="p1">By partially turning off the high beams, it is possible to brightly illuminate the surrounding area even when there is a vehicle in front of you. The portion of the high beams that are turned off changes according to the direction and distance of the vehicle in front of you, and the high beams are used to illuminate the widest possible area.
        On the other hand, the low beams always illuminate a certain range to ensure visibility in front of you.</p>
        <h1><ul type="square"><li>When there is a vehicle in front of you</li></ul></h1>
        <hr id="line">
        <p id="p1">The area surrounding the vehicle in front of you is illuminated with the high beams, and the high beams are only turned off for the area in front of you. The width of the area being turned off changes according to the distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.</p>

        <p id="p1">When seen from your vehicle, the angle to the vehicle in front of you changes when you are on a curve, so the high beam's direction is changed by turning off a portion of the high beams.</p>

        <h1><ul type="square"><li>When there is an oncoming vehicle</li></ul></h1>
        <hr id="line">
        <p id="p1">Similarly, when an oncoming vehicle is approaching, the direction and width of the portion of the high beams being turned off changes according to the position of the oncoming vehicle.</p>

        <h1><ul type="square"><li>System mechanism</li></ul></h1>
        <hr id="line">
        <p id="p1">The headlamps consist of a lamp for the low beams and a variable light distribution lamp for the high beams. Multiple LEDs are arranged in a horizontal row inside the variable light distribution lamp, and the high beam illumination distribution can be changed by turning each LED on or off independently.
            The vehicle in front of you is recognized by the multi-sensing front camera installed on the windshield. Based on the vehicleâ€˜s direction and distance information, the control unit determines the area where the high beams should not illuminate and then controls the variable light distribution lamp.</p>

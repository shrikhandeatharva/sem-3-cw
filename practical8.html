    <h1><u>AUTOMATIC STREEET LIGHT CONTROL </u></h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>OBJECTIVE AND GOALS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This project aims to design an automatic street light that works in both conventional as well as
            non-conventional energy resources.</li>
        <li> Using LDR we control the street light, when
            the LDR value falls above the threshold value the lights are switched on and when the value falls
            below the threshold value the lights are switched off.</li>
        <li>The main goal is to save eletricity. Because many a times, the street lights are on even in the morning when
            they are of no lot of energy can be saved if we use this mechanism.</ <li>we can save the man power, as well
            as reduce wastage of electricity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>SOFTWARE USED</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>uvision IDE (Keil) - For ARM</li>
        <li>Proteus - simulation tool</li>

    <h2>THE OROTICAL THINKING</h2>
    <p>During day time there is sunlight so we don't need any street lighting but during night time there's no lighting
        so we need street lights. so to make this more convenient we can design a project using hardware and software in
        which street lights turn on and off according to time on its own, also called an automatic street lighting
        project. In order to save and conserve energy in an efficient way we are designing this project. so there are
        two conditions in this project,one is day time and other is night time. Day time means full lighting and lights
        should be off. Night time means no light and lights should turn on automatically, so the hardware building
        blocks required for this project are sensors that are LDR (Light dependent resistors) as input devices and
        street lights are output devices which interface with microcontrollers. During day time Lol will offer very less
        resistance and during night time LDR will offer high resistance.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Day time (presence of 1ight) ---> LDR less resistance Lights turn off</li>
        <li>ight time(absence of light) ---> LDR high</li>
        <li>Input device ---> sensors LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)</li>
        <li>output device ---> street lights</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Light sensor</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Light sensor is used to sense the amount of light.</li>
        <li>Why is LDR preferred the most ? Because...
            <ul>
                <li> is cheap in price</li>
                    <li>Easily available in the market</li>
                    <li>can be easily interfaced with a microcontroller to sense intensity of light.</li> clista has the
                    property to change its resistance according to intensity of light. If light is high, LDR will have
                    low resistance and if light is low, LDR will have high Microcontrollers can easily read this
                    resistance in the form of voltage and
                    resistance.c/li>
                    which can be back converted into proportional value of light
        </li>
    </ul>
    </11>
    </ul>
    <h2>WORKING</h2>
    <p>THIS IS HOW VOLTAGE DIVIDER CIRCUIT WORKS
        In the voltage divider circuit there are two logic signals -</p>
    <li>Power-logic 1</li>
    <li>Ground-logic 0</li>
    </01>
    <p>In simulation part there are different modules like LDR and a voltage divider circuit (Vout-Vin r2/r1 r2) and
        on the basis of this we will get output voltage that is given to any one GPIO pin of a microcontroller. we
        are using a port 1-8 pin to connect the sensor to the microcontroller. And in output we are using different
        street lights like Port 2-0 to Port 2- 7 pins for interfacing street lights. During night time there is no
        light on LDR so it offers very high resistance and if there is light then resistance will be less.So in this
        case e logic is connected to the microcontroller. And in day time due to less resistance, input to the
        microcontroller will be 1.50 whenever input is 0 we need output as 1 and vice versa.</p>

            }<br>
            else<br>
            {<br>
            street light - 0X00;<br>
            }<br> }<br>
